# torch-utils

Three modules for now:

- `dump` – dump and open (mmap) tensors in a raw binary format. Faster and often more memory-efficient than classic serialization/deserialization. [Demo](dump-demo.ipynb).
- `metrics` and `dashboard` – collect and plot metrics. [Demo](metrics-dashboard-demo.ipynb) (please run on your machine, GitHub preview blocks JavaScript, so charts are not rendered). [Screenshot](metrics-dashboard-demo.png).

More comming soon – stay tunned!
